## Challenges
When building the website, I faced several challenges. Maintaining consistent styling and ensuring a responsive design across different devices was particularly difficult. Implementing CSS animations to create a dynamic user experience required meticulous attention to detail, as small typos often led to unexpected issues. Adhering to accessibility and SEO standards was another crucial aspect, requiring precision and thoughtful coding. One of the most complex tasks was getting the hero section to display exactly as intended and fine-tuning the phone media query to ensure a seamless experience. Despite these challenges, the project was a rewarding learning experience that improved my skills in web development and design.
